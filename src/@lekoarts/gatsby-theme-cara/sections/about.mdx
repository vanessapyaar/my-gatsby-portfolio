# About Me

Passionate about user-centered design and technology, I have 8 years of experience designing web experiences. I excell at combining digital trends and innovation with my understanding of UX practices, consumers, social networks, and brands.

I'm a scuba diver and I love the marine life. Living in the Caribbean has some benefits. I am a big enthusiast of the underwater world because it's pure magic. I love all the colors, harmony and sounds.

## My Design Process

My design process is based on a deep understanding of human behavior and of the end-user. I want to know what the user’s needs and pain points are, and then alleviate those pain-points. I include accessibility right from the start. Most people tend to wait until the end of projects to consider this aspect (too late!). I work towards making sure my design decisions are grounded in real knowledge and depth.

During contextual inquiries, I put myself in the shoes of the user and follow them around. From that, I feel prepared to supplement my insights with the right tool or technique at the time—whether it is via a direct study or questionnaire, or whether some concept testing needs to occur.
